Jumble
======

An Android service implementation of the Mumble protocol, designed as the backend of [Plumble](https://www.github.com/Morlunk/Plumble).

About
-----

The primary goal of the Jumble project is to encourage developers to embrace the Mumble protocol on Android through a free, complete, and stable implementation. At the moment, development is focused on improving stability and security.

Prior to the release of Jumble, all implementations of the Mumble protocol on Android have been using the same non-free code developed by @pcgod. To ensure the unencumbered use of Jumble, no sources or derivatives will be copied from that project.

As Jumble becomes more stable, new releases will start getting versioned and tagged.
